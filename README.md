# Middles
Repo containing middleware APIs and Services.

## Conventions:
* Project organization is done as follows: Language->Framework->API/Service Name

* Each Project should have a README.md file with instructions on how to get the service running.

* When building Docker images or to Kubernetes, use the naming convention `Language-Framework-ServiceName` for the main Image name and Namespace name.
